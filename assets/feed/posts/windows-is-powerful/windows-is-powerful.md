# Windows is powerful!

in the past few years, i've been going back and forth between using Arch linux and windows for my daily driver.
the powerful console of linux VS the just works! mentality of windows.
but now this has changed.

## WSL2 - Running Linux on Windows!

So today... i needed to install linux a virtual machine to use it on my operating systems course, but i didn't want to use a VM just to run Linux for my university course.
knowing wsl exists i decided to try it... and it is... one of the best pieces of software i've seen... the amount of features and the speed of it is just amazing... i'm really impressed with it... i've been using linux from time to time hopping to it and back to windows multiple times... what i like about using linux is the powerful shell which Windows doesn't compare to... but now i have the Linux shell in Windows. so i am literally running two OSs with very minimal overhead.

also, now i don't have to vm linux for my university course, i can just wsl it.

Look at this! neofetch on WSL2?

## Windows Terminal

I've been using linux from time to time, hopping to it and back to windows multiple times... what caused me to do so was the just works! mentality of windows. just installing software and it working, no configs. but what keeps me going to linux is the terminal, it is so powerful yet so customizable. windows only had third parties for a while, like cmder & alacritty. i used them and they were good, but too bloated for my taste.
then when switching to windows 11, i discovered Windows Terminal. microsoft's attempt at creating a shell emulator. and its good. they even made their own oh-my-zsh named oh-my-posh. with the ability to add shell profiles like bash which is what i use.
well at least microsoft learned from their powershell mistakes and made it a good shell emulator.

Look at this! neofetch on Windows Terminal? with oh-my-posh!
