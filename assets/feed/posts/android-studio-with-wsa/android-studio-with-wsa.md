# Using WSA with Android studio

last year i decided to make an anilist client to track anime and manga i watch, named it JAAC "Just Another Anilist Client". while learning android dev was fun, using android studio with a low memory system (8Gb) wasn't. so that project was left to the infinite abyss of unfinished projects.

now more than half a year later, i decided to get back into android dev. cause this time i have a new laptop with 16Gb of memory. but now the AVD (Android Virtual Device) hogs my cpu and everything becomes a laggy mess... using my own phone as a dev device is an option, but i want to keep it as a last resort cause i don't have it on me most of the time.

now... of all times while i was installing wsl to use for university i remembered that wsa exists and went to try it out. and it worked! i can use wsa to run and debug apps on android studio using wsa, no need for the memory memory or cpu intensive AVD. true some features may be missing like camera, gps, etc. but for my dev case. it is more than enough.
