# Happy eid(Eid mubarak to all muslims <3)

So, to day is marks the end of our sacred month, ramadan. eid mubarak guys

Tbh this year's ramadan was the most one of the most interesting months that i've ever gone through in my life, so much good and bad stuff happened but overall it was a great month :)

so basically i got really sick from my back on the start of the month, couldn't move for 2 weeks, but got through it and after that bought a new pc, yay the specs are :

- **NEW FANCY PC**
  - **CPU** - Intel i3 9100f 4x1 3.60Ghz
  - **RAM** - DDR4 4X2Gb 2666Mhz
  - **GPU** - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4Gb

which is a definite upgrade from my old:

- **OLD DUSTY PC**
  - **CPU** - Intel Pentium E5800 2x1 3.20Ghz
  - **RAM** - DDR3 2X2Gb 800Mhz
  - **GPU** - NVIDIA GeForce GT 610 2Gb

so now i have a pc that's actually capable of doing stuff that i wanted to do for years and i am pretty excited to do all the stuff i couldnt do before but i do have some studies i gotta catch up to so that gotta wait for some time.

so what am i planning to do? currently i just started understanding how android app making works(or i think i do) and i just started working on the anilist client i wanted to make before the end of ramadan but couldn't because of my back problems but now there shouldn't be anymore problems to stop from doing stuff, i hope.
